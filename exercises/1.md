Create a database called clickhouse_assignment. 
Next, create a table called students under this database with the necessary columns and appropriate datatypes.

```sql
create database clickhouse_assignment;
create table clickhouse_assignment.students(
    Name String,
    ID  UInt8 ,--(Unique ID - integers)
    Age UInt8,
    DateOfBirth Date,
    Gender String,
    City String,
    Country String
)ENGINE = Log;
```

Add another table in this database called exam_scores to store the marks scored
by the students in different courses with following information.

```sql
create table clickhouse_assignment.scores(
ID          UInt16,
Course      String, 
Score       Float32,
Pass        Enum('Pass' = 1, 'Fail' = 0), --Pass (Either Pass of Fail)
DateOfExam  Date
)Engine=Log;
```

Insert data
```sql
INSERT INTO clickhouse_assignment.students 
SELECT 
Name,
ID,
Age,
parseDateTimeBestEffort(DateOfBirth) as DateOfBirth,
Gender,
City,
Country
FROM file(
    '/var/lib/clickhouse/user_files/data/students.csv',
    'CSV');

INSERT INTO clickhouse_assignment.scores 
SELECT 
    ID,
    Course,
    Score,
    Pass,
    parseDateTimeBestEffort(DateOfExam) AS DateOfExam
FROM file(
    '/var/lib/clickhouse/user_files/data/scores.csv',
    'CSV');

```
